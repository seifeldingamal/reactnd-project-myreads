# MyReads Project

This project is done to show-off my newly acquired skilles in React.js

## Layout
- 2 views : 
    = List of shelves containing 3 different categories depending on the state of each book in my libirary
        * Currently Reading
        * Want to Read
        * Read
    = Search page to grab and add new books to my libirary

- Evey book in both views has a dropdown list to change each book's shelf or even remove it from the libirary
